# Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## 🎯Task Objective
To segment customers into meaningful groups based on their behavior.

## 🛠️ My Approach
1) Data preprocessing

        - Removed irrelevant columns

        - Scaled numerical features

2) Used K-Means Clustering

3) Determined optimal K using:

           - Elbow Method

           - Silhouette Score

4) Visualized clusters using PCA

## 📊 Results & Findings
1) Identified clear customer segments:

       - High-value customers

       - Medium customers

       - Low engagement customers

2) Business can:

    - Target premium users

    - Improve retention strategies

✔ Actionable Insight: High-spending customers need loyalty programs.
